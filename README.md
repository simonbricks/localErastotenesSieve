# A short python script that creates a localized Erastotenes' sieve on your computer and uses it to factor numbers.

* After running the python script, type in the number that you want to factorize.

* A "sieve.txt" file with prime numbers will be then created, and the program will output the factors of the input number.
  
* The "sieve.txt" file should stay in the same directory as the script, so that multiple copies of the file needn't to be created.
It grows in size and changes only when the next time the program is opened, a number with a bigger factor is typed in.

Enjoy!
